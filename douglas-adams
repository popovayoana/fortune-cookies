more intelligent than dolphins because he had achieved so much - the
wheel, New York, wars and so on, whilst all the dolphins had ever done
was muck about in the water having a good time. But conversely, the
dolphins had always believed that they were far more intelligent than
man for precisely the same reasons.

It is known that there are an infinite number of worlds, simply
because there is an infinite amount of space for them to be
in. However, not every one of them is inhabited. Therefore, there must
be a finite number of inhabited worlds. Any finite number divided by
infinity is as near to nothing as makes no odds, so the average
population of all the planets in the Universe can be said to be
zero. From this it follows that the population of the whole Universe
is also zero, and that any people you may meet from time to time are
merely the products of a deranged imagination.

have. Partly it has great practical value. You can wrap it around you
for warmth as you bound across the cold moons of Jaglan Beta; you can
lie on it on the brilliant marble-sanded beaches of Santraginus V,
inhaling the heady sea vapors; you can sleep under it beneath the
stars which shine so redly on the desert world of Kakrafoon; use it to
sail a miniraft down the slow heavy River Moth; wet it for use in
hand-to-hand-combat; wrap it round your head to ward off noxious fumes
or avoid the gaze of the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal (such a
mind-boggingly stupid animal, it assumes that if you can't see it, it
can't see you); you can wave your towel in emergencies as a distress
signal, and of course dry yourself off with it if it still seems to be

There was a moment's expectant pause while panels slowly came to life on the front of the console. Lights flashed on and off experimentally and settled down into a businesslike pattern. A soft low hum came from the communication channel.

"An Answer for you?" interrupted Deep Thought majestically. "Yes, I have."
