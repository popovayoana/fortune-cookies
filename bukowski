For those who believe in God, most of the big questions are
answered. But for those of us who can't readily accept the God
formula, the big answers don't remain stone-written. We adjust to new
conditions and discoveries. We are pliable. Love need not be a command
nor faith a dictum. I am my own god. We are here to unlearn the
teachings of the church, state, and our educational system. We are
here to drink beer. We are here to kill war. We are here to laugh at
the odds and live our lives so well that Death will tremble to take
us.

I've never been lonely. I've been in a room -- I've felt
suicidal. I've been depressed. I've felt awful -- awful beyond all --
but I never felt that one other person could enter that room and cure
what was bothering me...or that any number of people could enter that
room. In other words, loneliness is something I've never been bothered
with because I've always had this terrible itch for solitude. It's
being at a party, or at a stadium full of people cheering for
something, that I might feel loneliness. I'll quote Ibsen, "The
strongest men are the most alone." I've never thought, "Well, some
beautiful blonde will come in here and give me a fuck-job, rub my
balls, and I'll feel good." No, that won't help. You know the typical
crowd, "Wow, it's Friday night, what are you going to do? Just sit
there?" Well, yeah. Because there's nothing out there. It's
stupidity. Stupid people mingling with stupid people. Let them
stupidify themselves. I've never been bothered with the need to rush
out into the night. I hid in bars, because I didn't want to hide in
factories. That's all. Sorry for all the millions, but I've never been
lonely. I like myself. I'm the best form of entertainment I
have. Let's drink more wine!

If you're going to try, go all the way. Otherwise, don't even
start. This could mean losing girlfriends, wives, relatives and maybe
even your mind. It could mean not eating for three or four days. It
could mean freezing on a park bench. It could mean jail. It could mean
derision. It could mean mockery--isolation. Isolation is the gift. All
the others are a test of your endurance, of how much you really want
to do it. And, you'll do it, despite rejection and the worst odds. And
it will be better than anything else you can imagine. If you're going
to try, go all the way. There is no other feeling like that. You will
be alone with the gods, and the nights will flame with fire. You will
ride life straight to perfect laughter. It's the only good fight there
is.

Drinking is an emotional thing. It joggles you out of the standardism of everyday life, out of everything being the same. It yanks you out of your body and your mind and throws you against the wall.

I guess I've lived about ten or fifteen thousand lives now.

There's nothing to mourn about death any more than there is to mourn about the growing of a flower. What is terrible is not death but the lives people live or don't live up until their death. They don't honor their own lives, they piss on their lives. They shit them away. Dumb fuckers. They concentrate too much on fucking, movies, money, family, fucking. Their minds are full of cotton. They swallow God without thinking, they swallow country without thinking. Soon they forget how to think, they let others think for them. Their brains are stuffed with cotton. They look ugly, they talk ugly, they walk ugly. Play them the great music of the centuries and they can't hear it. Most people's deaths are a sham. There's nothing left to die.

Love is a form of prejudice. You love what you need, you love what makes you feel good, you love what is convenient. How can you say you love one person when there are ten thousand people in the world that you would love more if you ever met them? But you'll never meet them. All right, so we do the best we can. Granted. But we must still realize that love is just the result of a chance encounter. Most people make too much of it. On these grounds a good fuck is not to be entirely scorned. But that's the result of a chance meeting too. You're damned right. Drink up. We'll have another.

Human relationships didn't work anyhow. Only the first two weeks had
any zing, then the participants lost their interest. Masks dropped
away and real people began to appear: cranks, imbeciles, the demented,
the vengeful, sadists, killers. Modern society had created its own
kind and they feasted on each other. It was a duel to the death--in a

My objection to war was not that I had to kill somebody or be killed senselessly, that hardly mattered. What I objected to was to be denied the right to sit in a small room and starve and drink cheap wine and go crazy in my own way and at my own leisure.

Forgive me, I guess I am off in the head, but I mean, except for a quickie piece of ass it wouldn't matter to me if all the people in the world died. Yes, I know it's not nice. But I'd be as contended as a snail; it was, after all, the people who had made me unhappy.

I loved you
like a man loves a woman he never touches, only
writes to, keeps little photographs of. I would have
loved you more if I had sat in a small room rolling a
cigarette and listened to you piss in the bathroom,
but that didnt happen. your letters got sadder.
your lovers betrayed you. kid, I wrote back, all
lovers betray.

The nights you fight best are
when all the weapons are pointed at you,
when all the voices hurl their insults
while the dream is being strangled.

The nights you fight best are
when reason gets kicked in the gut,
when the chariots of gloom encircle you.

The nights you fight best are
when the laughter of fools fills the air,
when the kiss of death is mistaken for love.

The nights you fight best are
when the game is fixed,
when the crowd screams for your blood.

The nights you fight best are
on a night like this
as you chase a thousand dark rats from your brain,
as you rise up against the impossible,
as you become a brother to the tender sister of joy

and move on

regardless.

I
have a face like a washrag. I sing
love songs and carry steel.

I would rather die than cry. I can't
stand hounds can't live without them.
I hang my head against the white
refrigerator and want to scream like
the last weeping of life forever but
I am bigger than the mountains.

You know the typical crowd, Wow, its Friday night, what are you going to do? Just sit there? Well, yeah. Because theres nothing out there. Its stupidity. Stupid people mingling with stupid people. Let them stupidify themselves. Ive never been bothered with the need to rush out into the night. Thats all. Sorry for all the millions, but Ive never been lonely. I like myself. Im the best form of entertainment I have.

In the old days, before I was married, or knew a lot of women, I would just pull down all the shades and go to bed for three or four days. I'd get up to shit. I'd eat a can of beans, go back to bed, just stay there for three or four days. Then I'd put on my clothes and I'd walk outside, and the sunlight was brilliant, and the sounds were great. I felt powerful, like a recharged battery. But you know the first bring-down? The first human face I saw on the sidewalk, I lost half my charge right there.

I didn't like parties.I didn't know how to dance and people frightened me, especially people at parties. They attempted to be sexy and gay and witty and although they hoped they were good at it, they weren 't. They were bad at it. Their trying so hard only made it worse.
