Anybody can look at a pretty girl and see a pretty girl. An artist can
look at a pretty girl and see the old woman she will become. A better
artist can look at an old woman and see the pretty girl that she used
to be. But a great artist-a master-and that is what Auguste Rodin
was-can look at an old woman, protray her exactly as she is...and
force the viewer to see the pretty girl she used to be...and more than
that, he can make anyone with the sensitivity of an armadillo, or even
you, see that this lovely young girl is still alive, not old and ugly
at all, but simply prisoned inside her ruined body. He can make you
feel the quiet, endless tragedy that there was never a girl born who
ever grew older than eighteen in her heart...no matter what the
merciless hours have done to her. Look at her, Ben. Growing old
doesn't matter to you and me; we were never meant to be admired-but it
does to them.

Do not confuse "duty" with what other people expect of you; they are
utterly different. Duty is a debt you owe to yourself to fulfill
obligations you have assumed voluntarily. Paying that debt can entail
anything from years of patient work to instant willingness to
die. Difficult it may be, but the reward is self-respect.

But there is no reward at all for doing what other people expect of
you, and to do so is not merely difficult, but impossible. It is
easier to deal with a footpad than it is with the leech who wants
"just a few minutes of your time, pleasethis won't take long." Time is
your total capital, and the minutes of your life are painfully few. If
you allow yourself to fall into the vice of agreeing to such requests,
they quickly snowball to the point where these parasites will use up
100 percent of your timeand squawk for more!

So learn to say no and to be rude about it when necessary. Otherwise
you will not have time to carry out your duty, or to do your own work,
and certainly no time for love and happiness. The termites will nibble
away your life and leave none of it for you.

(This rule does not mean that you must not do a favor for a friend, or
even a stranger. But let the choice be yours. Don't do it because it
is "expected" of you.)

Secrecy is the keystone to all tyranny. Not force, but secrecy and
censorship. When any government or church for that matter, undertakes
to say to its subjects, "This you may not read, this you must not
know," the end result is tyranny and oppression, no matter how holy
the motives. Mighty little force is needed to control a man who has
been hoodwinked in this fashion; contrariwise, no amount of force can
control a free man, whose mind is free.  No, not the rack nor the
atomic bomb, not anything. You can't conquer a free man; the most you
can do is kill him.

The America of my time line is a laboratory example of what can happen to democracies, what has eventually happened to all perfect democracies throughout all histories.  A perfect democracy, a warm body democracy in which every adult may vote and all votes count equally, has no internal feedback for self-correction.  It depends solely on the wisdom and self-restraint of citizens... which is opposed by the folly and lack of self-restraint of other citizens.  What is supposed to happen in a democracy is that each sovereign citizen will always vote in the public interest for the safety and welfare of all.  But what does happen is that he votes his own self-interest as he sees it... which for the majority translates as Bread and Circuses.

Bread and Circuses is the cancer of democracy, the fatal disease for which there is no cure.  Democracy often works beautifully at first.  But once a state extends the franchise to every warm body, be he producer or parasite, that day marks the beginning of the end of the state.  For when the plebs discover that they can vote themselves bread and circuses without limit and that the productive members of the body politic cannot stop them, they will do so, until the state bleeds to death, or in its weakened condition the state succumbs to an invaderthe barbarians enter Rome.

Political tags  such as royalist, communist, democrat, populist, fascist, liberal, conservative, and so forth  are never basic criteria.
