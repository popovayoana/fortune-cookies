I admit that "Love in the time of . . ." is a great title, up to a
point. You're reading along, you're happy, it's about love. I like the
way the word time comes in - a nice, nice feeling. Then the morbid
Cholera appears. I was happy till then. Why not "Love in the Time of
the Blue, Blue, Bluebirds"? "Love in the Time of Oozing Sores and
Pustules" is probably an earlier title the author used as he was
writing in a rat-infested tree house on an old Smith Corona. This
writer, whoever he is, could have used a couple of weeks in Pacific

Scientists at first were skeptical that a kitten-type being could

were put in a chamber that simulated the Martian air. The diary of
this experiment is fascinating:

6:00 A.M.: Kittens appear to sleep.
7:02 A.M.: Kitten wakes, darts from one end of cage to another for no
apparent reason.

7:14 A.M.: Kitten runs up wall of cage, leaps onto other kitten for no
apparent reason.

7:22 A.M.: Kitten lies on back and punches other kitten for no
apparent reason.

7:30 A.M.: Kitten leaps, stops, darts left, abruptly stops, climbs
wall, clings for two seconds, falls on head, darts right for no
apparent reason.

7:51 A.M.: Kitten parses first sentence of daily newspaper that is at
bottom of chamber.

With the exception of the parsing, all behavior is typical of Earth
kitten behavior. The parsing activity, which was done with a small
ball-point pen, was an anomaly.

both you and paintings are layered... first, ephemera and notations on the back of the canvas. Labels indicate gallery shows, museum shows, footprints in the snow, so to speak. Then pencil scribbles on the stretcher, usually by the artist, usually a title or date. Next the stretcher itself. Pine or something. Wooden triangles in the corners so the picture can be tapped tighter when the canvas becomes loose. Nails in the wood securing the picture to the stretcher. Next, a canvas: linen, muslin, sometimes a panel; then the gesso - a primary coat, always white. A layer of underpaint, usually a pastel color, then, the miracle, where the secrets are: the paint itself, swished around, roughly, gently, layer on layer, thick or thin, not more than a quarter of an inch ever -- God can happen in that quarter of an inch -- the occasional brush hair left embedded, colors mixed over each other, tones showing through, sometimes the weave of the linen revealing itself. The signature on top of the entire goulash. Then varnish is swabbed over the whole. Finally, the frame, translucent gilt or carved wood. The whole thing is done.

...My father muttered something to me, and I responded with a mumbled
"What". He shouted, "You heard me," thundered up from his chair,
pulled his belt out of its loops, and inflicted a beating that seemed
never to end. I curled my arms around my body as he stood over me like
a titan and delivered the blows. This was the only incident of its
kind in our family. My father was never physically abusive toward my
mother or sister and he was never again physically extreme with
me. However, this beating and his worsening tendency to rages directed
at my mother - which I heard in fright through the thin walls of our
home - made me resolve, with icy determination, that only the most
formal relationship would exist between my father and me, and for
perhaps thirty years, neither he nor I did anything to repair the
rift.

The rest of my childhood, we hardly spoke; there was little he said to
me that was not critical, and there was little I said back that was
not terse or mumbled. When I graduated from high school, he offered to
buy me a tuxedo. I refused because I had learned from him to reject
all aid and assistance; he detested extravagance and pleaded with us
not to give him gifts. I felt, through a convoluted logic, that in my
refusal, I was being a good son. I wish now that I had let him buy me
a tuxedo, that I had let him be a dad. Having cut myself off from him,
and by association the rest of the family, I was incurring
psychological debts that would come due years later in the guise of
romantic misconnections and a wrongheaded quest for solitude.

What if there were no punch lines? What if there were no indicators? What if I created tension and never released it? What if I headed for a climax, but all I delivered was an anticlimax? What would the audience do with all that tension? Theoretically, it would have to come out sometime. But if I kept denying them the formality of a punch line, the audience would eventually pick their own place to laugh, essentially out of desperation. This type of laugh seemed stronger to me, as they would be laughing at something they chose, rather than being told exactly when to laugh.

It was easy to be great. Every entertainer has a night when everything is clicking. These nights are accidental and statistical: Like lucky cards in poker, you can count on them occurring over time. What was hard was to be good, consistently good, night after night, no matter what the abominable circumstances.

Free love, man, Free Love! Which, by the way, was the single greatest concept a young man has ever heard. About three years late, women got wise an my frustration returned to normal levels.

The public has a short memory. That's why all these big stars do these crazy, terrible things and two years later they're back in the biz, you know. 'Cause the public has a short memory. Let me give you a little test, okay? This is my thesis -- the public has a short memory and, like-- How many people remember, a couple of years ago, when the Earth blew up? How many people? See? So few people remember. And you would think that something like that, people would remember. But NOOO! You don't remember that? The Earth blew up and was completely destroyed? And we escaped to this planet on the giant Space Ark? Where have you people been? And the government decided not to tell the stupider people 'cause they thought that it might affect-- [dawning realization, looks around] Ohhhh! Okay! Uh, let's move on!

The Feynman Dilemma

A diner says to a waiter, Whats this fly doing in my soup? And the waiter says, It looks like the backstroke. Yet if the same scene is viewed while plunging into a black hole at the speed of light, it will look like a Mickey Mouse lunch pail from the thirties, except that Mickeys head has been replaced by a Lincoln penny

I was seeking comic originality, and fame fell on me as a by-product. The course was more plodding than heroic: I did not strive valiantly against doubters but took incremental steps studded with a few intuitive leaps.

Dogs in My Nose --

When I woke up that morning, it didn't take me long to realize there were dogs in my nose. I could hear their muffled barks; I could feel their playful vibrations.

It's not dangerous to have dogs in your nose, in fact, it's quite all right to leave them in there for an hour or so. But in this case, because they got in there without permission, I decided to expel them immediately, coaxing them out with a piece of hamburger.

The dogs popped out and landed on the floor. They shook their little floppy ears and bounded off, and I was amused at the prospect of some other weary traveler awakening to find he had dogs in his nose.

Bohemians.

These Bohemians, Mr. and Mrs. Clarence Williams, and their seven children, Biff, Tina, Sparky, Louise, Tuffy, Mickey, and Biff Number Two, lived in a notorious artist's colony and planned community.

Naturally, the bohemian's existence thrived on creativity. Early in the morning, Mrs. Williams would rise and create breakfast. Then, Mr. Williams, inspired by his wife's limitless energy, would rush off to a special room and create tiny hairs in a sink. The children would create things, too. But being temperamental artists, they would often flush them away without a second thought.

But the bohemians' creativity didn't stop there. Mr. Williams would then rush off downtown and create reams and reams of papers with numbers on them and send them out to other Bohemians who would create special checks to send to him with figures like $7.27written on them.

At home, the children would be creating unusual music, using only their voices to combine in avant-garde, atonal melodies.

Yes, these were the bohemians. A seething hot-bed of rebellion-the artists, the creators of all things that lie between good and bad.
