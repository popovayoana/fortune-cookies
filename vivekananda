Take up one idea. Make that one idea your life; dream of it; think of
it; live on that idea. Let the brain, the body, muscles, nerves, every
part of your body be full of that idea, and just leave every other
idea alone. This is the way to success, and this is the way great
spiritual giants are produced.

What can prevail over you?  You are the God of the universe; where can
you seek for help?  Never help came from anywhere but from yourself.
In your ignorance, every prayer that you made and that was answered,
you thought was answered by some Being, but you answered the prayer
yourself unknowingly.  The help came from yourself, and you fondly
imagined that someone was sending help to you.  There is no help for
you outside of yourself; you are the creator of the universe.  Like

We must also remember that in every little village-god and every
little superstitious custom is that which we are accustomed to call
our religious faith.  But local customs are infinite and
contradictory.  Which are we to obey, and which not to obey?  The
Brahmin of Southern India, for instance, would shrink in horror at the
sight of another Brahmin eating meat; a Brahmin in the North thinks it
a most glorious and holy thing to dohe kills goats by the hundred in
sacrifice.  If you put forward your custom, they are equally ready
with theirs.  Various are the customs all over India, but they are
local.  The greatest mistake made is that ignorant people always think
that this local custom is the essence of our religion.

The one great advantage of Bhakti is that it is the easiest and most
natural way to reach the great divine end in view; it's great
disadvantage is that in its lower forms it oftentimes degenerates into
hideous fanaticism.  The fanatical crew in Hinduism, Mohammedanism, or
Christianity, have always been almost exclusively recruited from these
worshippers [sic] on the lower planes of Bhakti.  That singleness of
attachment (Nishtha) to a loved object, without which no genuine love
can grow, is very often also the cause of the denunciation of
everything else.  All the weak and undeveloped minds in every religion
or country have only one way of loving their own ideal, i.e., by
hating every other ideal.  Herein is the explanation of why the same
man who is so lovingly attached to his own ideal of God, so devoted to
his own ideal of religion, becomes a howling fanatic as soon as he
sees or hears anything of any other ideal.

But there is yet time to change our ways.  Give up all those old
discussions, old fights about things which are meaningless, which are
nonsensical in their very nature.  Think of the last six hundred or
seven hundred years of degradation when grown-up men by hundreds have
been discussing for years whether we should drink a glass of water
with the right hand or the left, whether the hand should be washed
three times or four times, whether we should gargle five or six times.
What can you expect from men who pass their lives in discussing such
momentous questions as these and writing most learned philosophies on
them!  There is a danger of our religion getting into the kitchen.  We
are neither Vedantists, most of us now, nor Pauranics, nor Tantrics.
We are just "Don't-touchists".  Our religion is in the kitchen.  Our
God is the cooking-pot, and our religion is, "Don't touch me, I am
holy".  If this goes on for another century, every one of us will be
in a lunatic asylum.  It is a sure sign of softening of the brain when
the mind cannot grasp the higher problems of life; all originality is
lost, the mind has lost all its strength, its activity, and its power
of thought, and just tries to go round and round the smallest curve it

Though our castes and institutions are apparently linked with our

protect us as a nation, and when this necessity for self-preservation
will no more exist, they will die a natural death.  But the older I
grow, the better I seem to think of these time-honored institutions of
India.  There was a time when I used to think that many of them were
useless and worthless; but the older I grew, the more I seem to feel a
diffidence in cursing any one of them, for each one of them is the
embodiment of the experience of centuries.  A child of but yesterday,
destined to die the day after tomorrow, comes to me and asks me to
change all my plans; and if I hear the advice of that baby and change
all my surroundings according to his ideas, I myself should be a fool,
and no one else.  Much of the advice that is coming to us from
different countries is similar to this.  Tell these wiseacres: "I will
hear you when you have made a society yourselves.  You cannot hold on
to one idea for two days, you quarrel and fail; you are born like
moths in the spring and die like them in five minutes.  You come up
like bubbles and burst like bubbles too.  First form a stable society

Curiously enough, it seems that at times the spiritual side prevails,
and then the materialistic sidein wave-like motions following each
other. ...At one time the full flood of materialistic ideas prevails,
and everything in this lifeprosperity, the education which procures
more pleasures, more foodwill become glorious at first and then that
will degrade and degenerate.  Along with the prosperity will rise to
white heat all the inborn jealousies and hatreds of the human race.
Competition and merciless cruelty will be the watchword of the day.
To quote a very commonplace and not very elegant English proverb,
"Everyone for himself, and the devil take the hindmost", becomes the
motto of the day.  Then people think that the whole scheme of life is
a failure.  And the world would be destroyed had not spirituality come
to the rescue and lent a helping hand to the sinking world.  Then the
world gets new hope and finds a new basis for a new building, and
another wave of spirituality comes, which in time again declines.  As
a rule, spirituality brings a class of men who lay exclusive claim to
the special powers of the world.  The immediate effect of this is a
reaction towards materialism, which opens the door to scores of
exclusive claims, until the time comes when not only all the spiritual
powers of the race, but all its material powers and privileges are
centered in the hands of a very few; and these few, standing on the
necks of the masses of the people, want to rule them.  Then society
has to help itself, and materialism comes to the rescue.

Take up one idea. Make that one idea your life; dream of it; think of
it; live on that idea. Let the brain, the body, muscles, nerves, every
part of your body be full of that idea, and just leave every other
idea alone. This is the way to success, and this is the way great
spiritual giants are produced.

The Christian is not to become a Hindu or a Buddhist, nor is a Hindu
or a Buddhist to become a Christian. But each must assimilate the
spirit of the others and yet preserve his individuality and grow
according to his own law of growth. If the Parliament of Religions has
shown anything to the world, it is this: It has proved to the world
that holiness, purity, and charity are not the exclusive possessions
of any church in the world, and that every system has produced men and
women of the most exalted character. In the face of this evidence, if
anybody dreams of the exclusive survival of his own religion at the
expense of the others, I pity him from the bottom of my heart and
point out to him that upon the banner of every religion will soon be
written, in spite of resistance: "Help and not Fight," "Assimilation
and not Destruction," "Harmony and Peace and not Dissension".

Vairagya or renunciation is the turning point in all the various
Yogas.  The Karmi (worker) renounces the fruits of his work.  The
Bhakta (devotee) renounces all little loves for the almighty and
omnipresent love.  The Yogi renounces his experiences, because his
philosophy is that the whole Nature, although it is for the experience
of the soul, at last brings him to know that he is not in Nature, but
eternally separate from Nature.  The Jnani (philosopher) renounces
everything, because his philosophy is that Nature never existed,
neither in the past, nor present, nor will It in the future.

This human body is the greatest body in the universe, and a human
being the greatest being. Man is higher than all animals, than all
angels; none is greater than man. Even the Devas (gods) will have to
come down again and attain to salvation through a human body. Man
alone attains to perfection, not even the Devas.

Animals cannot have any high thoughts; nor can the Angels or Devas
attain to direct freedom without human birth.
