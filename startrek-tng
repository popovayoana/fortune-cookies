Jean-Luc Picard: If we're going to be damned, let's be damned for what we really are.

Jean-Luc Picard: Someone once told me that time was a predator that stalked us all our lives. But I rather believe that time is a companion who goes with us on the journey and reminds us to cherish every moment because they'll never come again. What we leave behind is not as important as how we've lived. After all, Number One, we're only mortal.

Jean-Luc Picard: Things are only impossible until they're not!
%
Jean-Luc Picard: No being is so important that he can usurp the rights of another.
%
Jean-Luc Picard: It is possible to commit no mistakes and still lose. That is not a weakness; that is life.
%
Jean-Luc Picard: Being first at any cost is not always the point.
%
Jean-Luc Picard: You know, there are some words I've known since I was a schoolboy. "With the first link, the chain is forged. The first speech censored, the first thought forbidden, the first freedom denied, chains us all irrevocably." Those words were uttered by Judge Aaron Satie as wisdom and warning. The first time any man's freedom is trodden on, we're all damaged.
%
Jean-Luc Picard: The road from legitimate suspicion to rampant paranoia is very much shorter than we think.
%
Jean-Luc Picard: Mr. Worf, villains who twirl their moustaches are easy to spot. Those who clothe themselves in good deeds are well-camouflaged.
%
Jean-Luc Picard: Vigilance, Mr. Worf. That is the price we must continually pay.
%
Jean-Luc Picard: Seize the time... Live now! Make now always the most precious time. Now will never come again.
%
Jean-Luc Picard: There is a way out of every box, a solution to every puzzle; it's just a matter of finding it.

Jean-Luc Picard: We are what we are, and we're doing the best we can. It is not for you to set the standards by which we should be judged!

"Yes."
"Will you take care of Spot for me ?"
"Your animal ?"

"He will need to be fed once a day. He prefers feline supplement number 25."
"I understand."
"And he will require water, and you must provide him with a sand box.
 And you must talk to him. Tell him he is a pretty cat .. and a good cat."
"I will feed him."
"Perhaps that will be enough."

"How long before we have warp power again ?"
"Well, we have got to manufacture a new conduit, that's at least
 six hours' work."
"Six hours! The banquet will be completely over by then. That's
 very unfortunate."

"No, NO, no. I wouldn't want to sacrifice the safety of the ship."

"So am I."
"What ?"
"I'm thirsty too."
"I didn't say anything about being thirsty."

"This way."
"You don't really know, do you ?"
"What ?"
"I mean, you are acting like you know exactly which way to go, but you are
 only guessing. Do you do this all the time ?"
"No, but there .. are times when it is necessary for a captain to give the
 appearance of confidence."
	-- Picard and Beverly in ST:TNG "Attached"
%
"Why is Spot under the bed ?"
"Probably because she knows if I catch her, I'm gonna kill her."
"Has Spot been misbehaving ?"
"So far, she's broken a vase, a teapot, she's ruined one of my chairs using
 it as a scratchpost and she has gotten hair-balls all over my carpet."
"These incidents are common to cat-owners. When you borrowed Spot, you said
 you wanted to experience the full range of feline behavior before getting
 a cat yourself."

"Unfortunately, I have been less than successful." [at training Spot]

 moment might do the trick."

%
"What did she train her cat to do ?"
"She had that cat jumping on her arm on command."
"Interesting. Perhaps I can modify your sister's techniques to keep Spot from
 jumping on the console. Do you know how she was able to train her cat ?"

 her blouse."

Geordi: "Basically, she's a Soong-type android except everything about her
	 is designed to fool you into thinking she's human."
Beverly:"She has tear ducts .. sweat glands .. even veins and capillaries
	 underneath her skin."
Riker:	"Why does the scanner read her as human?"
Beverly:"Because she has a feedback processor designed to send out a false
	 biosignal."
Geordi: "Part of her aging program. Not only does she age in appearance
	 like Data, her vital signs change, too."

"I hope our sudden appearance didn't startle you."

 consequences, it would be an awful shame if your ship would damage
 due to some misunderstanding."

 be in any danger."

"So, how long have you had that beard ?"
"About four years. I got tired hearing how young I looked."

"Sir, I'm little puzzled. Why are we intentionally damaging the
 shuttle-craft ?"
"We're evaluating hull resiliency. Starfleet requires periodic testing."
"I see. .. I don't believe I am familiar with that requirement."
"Probably because you are not a senior officer."
	-- Ensign Taurik and Geordi in ST:TNG "Lower Decks"
%
"That would be consistent."
"Consistent with what ?"
"With making it appear that this shuttle had fled an attack."
"What makes you think that's what we are doing ?"
"The pattern of fire you asked for is similar to what might result if the
 shuttle had fled an attacker while engaged in evasive maneuvers."
"It's an amazing coincidence."
"Yes, sir. It is indeed. Shall we proceed with the testing ?"
	-- Ensign Taurik and Geordi in ST:TNG "Lower Decks"
%
"It takes courage to say the test is unfair."
	-- Worf to Ensign Sito in ST:TNG "Lower Decks"
%
"Quite so, quite so. I'm sure my grandmother would've called our friend here a
 demon or a spirit or some sort of monster, but current scientific methodology
 allows us to dismiss such ridiculous superstitions and concentrate on
 scientific reality."

Gorta: "My personal code of conduct prohibits sharing. But I consider a

 have been honorable, can't we trust that the sum of those experiences will
 be the same ?"
